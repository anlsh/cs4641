Downloading my code
----------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/xanlsh/cs4641-project3.git

Running my code
----------------------------------------------------------
1. First, please "cd" into the top-level repository folder (cs4641-project3) to ensure that my code
   can find certain files as it needs to.

2. Second, please install all dependencies by running "pip installl -r requirements.txt"

3. I provide all of my code in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, one for each dataset
   (specifically, cs4641_project3_cifar.ipynb and cs4641_project3_imdb.ipynb)

   To run my experiments, you can simply open up a notebook and run the cells in
   sequence. This will take care of running the code, generating graphs, etc. Some
   cells are optional, and are clearly marked as such
